# AWS Incident Response 
Investigation of API activity using Athena
and notification of actions using EventBridge

## Introduction
This project explores useful CloudTrail events that support incident response and detection of misconfigurations. Documenting the queries and filters used to identify these CloudTrail events helps to:

* build a timeline of events
* understand the scope of the incident
* identify indicators of compromise
* decrease time to containment and recovery

Mis-configurations are important events to identify early. These configurations may introduce a vulnerability, but may also be an indicator of compromise. 

Whether executed manually or by automating, this information may be used to develop incident response playbooks. These types of formalization activities promote a consistent, efficient, and effective response to security incidents. 

To-do:
- [ ] more service coverage (particularly network and storage)
- [ ] consistent mapping to ATT&CK
- [ ] CloudWatch Metrics Filters - equivalent filters for existing EventBridge filters
- [ ] more language addressing the AWS Incident Response doc (June 2020) and Well Architected Lab
- [ ] response playbooks?
- [ ] bring VPC FlowLogs or any other log source in scope?

## Why Athena?
CloudTrail logs should be stored and archived in S3, where they are essentially useless unless integrated with another product or service. Amazon Athena allows you to query these JSON-formatted logs using standard SQL. This approach gives access to a potentially massive amount of CloudTrail data without the cost and effort of implementing Splunk, ElasticSearch, or storing in another database.

### Getting Started
Athena charges for the data scanned for each query. You may only return one record, but will be charged for all data queried to match that record. By default, S3 data is not indexed, so Athena will inefficiently scan a LOT of data. There are also S3 charges (GET requests) that factor in at larger scale.

**But, we can make Athena faster and cost effective by creating partitions.**
Implement CloudTrail Partitioner. By default, Partitioner will create a virtual table for each AWS account so you don't scan an entire aggregated bucket. Partitioner will also add the following partitions:
* region
* year
* month
* day

Including these partitions in your SQL statements, as shown throughout this project, significantly improves query performance by limiting the amount of data scanned. Limiting the amount of data scanned saves money. For ad-hoc queries, such as those used for incident response, this cost is negligible.

### Alternatives
* query direct from CloudTrail: no cost, very limiting query syntax
* query direct from CloudWatch Logs: higher cost than S3, fast query performance but weaker query syntax
* ingest logs in Splunk, ElasticSearch, etc: expensive

## Why EventBridge?
> EventBridge builds on CloudWatch Events and uses the same APIs. This is essentially CloudWatch Events.

Querying CloudTrail, even if automated, is best suited for ad-hoc **response** to finding misconfigurations and investigating incidents. Many of these configuration-related indicators of compromise can be detected in near real time. EventBridge allows for these pre-defined CloudTrail events to be filtered and integrated with numerous alerting methods (e.g. SNS) and event flows (e.g. Lambda, 3rd party SIEM).

This approach is independent of the Athena queries, but both approaches complement each other.

The Terraform section of this project repo includes deployable event filters with a basic SNS notification. Where applicable, Athena queries on this page are reflected in these event filters.

EventBridge is cheap for this use case.

# Incidents
The following section builds a collection of common incidents and the Athena queries that may prove useful in response. These queries attempt to explain timeline, scope,  impact, and surface indicators of compromise. 

## General IAM Investigation
> Some of the queries in this section were inspired by the following
> Reference: https://wellarchitectedlabs.com/security/300_labs/300_incident_response_with_aws_console_and_cli/2_iam/

### API Errors
```
select eventTime, eventSource, eventName, errorCode, errorMessage, responseElements, awsRegion, userIdentity.arn, sourceIPAddress, userAgent
from from cloudtrail_000000000000
and year = '####' and month = '##'
and errorCode in ('Client.UnauthorizedOperation','Client.InvalidPermission.NotFound','Client.OperationNotPermitted','AccessDenied')
order by eventTime desc
limit 25
```

### Activity from potentially malicious source ip
```
select eventTime, eventSource, eventName, awsRegion, userIdentity.arn, sourceIPAddress, userAgent
from from cloudtrail_000000000000
and year = '####' and month = '##'
and sourceIPAddress = 'x.x.x.x'
order by eventTime desc
limit 25
```

### S3 ListBuckets 
The ListBuckets API action, used to enumerate buckets within an AWS account, is a potential indicator of compromise.
```
select eventTime, eventSource, eventName, awsRegion, errorCode, errorMessage, userIdentity.arn, sourceIPAddress, userAgent
from from cloudtrail_000000000000
and year = '####' and month = '##'
and eventName = 'ListBuckets'
limit 25
```

## Incident: Access Key Exposure
We are looking for the following:
* what actions has this key been used for, historically and currently?
* has this key been used from any odd locations?
* has this key been used from any odd user agents?
* dig for any signs of established persistence to include or data access

These queries must include all AWS Regions.

### Find the IAM Principal and AWS Account associated with Access Key
```
select useridentity.principalId, useridentity.arn, useridentity.accountId, region
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where year = '####' and month = '##'
and useridentity.accesskeyid = 'AKIAxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
limit 1
```

### All key usage
Looking for high risk events that indicate establishing persistence, escalating permissions, resource creation (denial-of-wallet), data access (exfiltration). These actions may include:
* iam:CreateUser
* iam:CreateAccessKey
* iam:CreateLoginProfile
* iam:UpdateLoginProfile

Pay attention to all actions identified for priviledge escalation in this document.
```
select eventtime, eventsource, eventname, sourceipaddress, errorcode, useragent
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where useridentity.accesskeyid = 'AKIAxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
and year = '####' and month = '##'
```

### Activity for a specific IAM User
`userIdentity.arn` determined from the above query.
```
select eventtime, eventsource, eventname, errorcode, sourceipaddress, useragent
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where year = '####' and month = '##'
and userIdentity.arn = 'arn:aws:iam::000000000000:user/xxxxxxxx'
order by eventtime desc
```

Limit some noise.
```
select eventtime, eventsource, eventname, errorcode, sourceipaddress, useragent
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where year = '####' and month = '##'
and userIdentity.arn = 'arn:aws:iam::000000000000:user/xxxxxxxx'
and eventName not like 'Describe%'
and eventName not like 'List%'
and eventName not like 'Get%'
order by eventtime desc
```

### Look for user agent anomalies for key
Determine "normal" for user agent string
```
select useragent, count(*) as total
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where useridentity.accesskeyid = 'AKIAxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
and year = '####' and month = '##'
group by useragent
order by total desc
```

Assess activity for a specific user agent string; Conditions may be added to limit to a specific user or credential.
```
select eventtime, eventsource, eventname, sourceipaddress, errorcode
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where year = '####' and month = '##'
and useragent = 'seeAbove'
```

Group by user to include all access for a single user. This approach would be helpful if keys are rotated or a console login is used.
> This value format is for an IAM user and not an assumed role
```
select useragent, count(*) as total
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where year = '####' and month = '##'
and userIdentity.userName = 'xxxxxx'
group by useragent
order by total desc
```

### Look for source ip anomalies
Group by sourceIpAddress for a specific access key.

```
select sourceipaddress, count(*) as total
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where year = '####' and month = '##'
and useridentity.accesskeyid = 'AKIAxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
group by sourceipaddress
order by total desc
```

Assess all activity for a specific source IP, typically one believed to be an adversary in the case of a compromised key.
```
select eventtime, eventsource, eventname, errorcode, useragent
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where sourceipaddress = 'seeAbove'
and year = '####'
and month = '##'
```

Group by user to include multiple credentials for a single user. This approach would be helpful if keys are rotated or a console login is used.
> This value format is for an IAM user and not an assumed role
```
select sourceipaddress, count(*) as total
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where year = '####' and month = '##'
and userIdentity.userName = 'xxxxxx'
group by sourceipaddress
order by total desc
```

## Incident: EC2 Instance Compromise
EC2 instances may have an IAM Role attached to them. The combination of the instance and the role is called an "instance profile". When the role is assumed, the EC2 instance ID is used as the session name part of the Principal ARN in CloudTrail. We can identify actions of EC2 instances using the clause ```useridentity.principalid like '%:i-%'``` or a specific EC2 instance ```useridentity.principalid like '%:i-00000000000000000'```

The actions of EC2 instances will typically be repetitive and persistent, because all actions are presumed to be initiated by software and not a human. Play close attention to any anomalous API calls. An attacker with access to an EC2 instance has access to any IAM permissions granted to that instance via the instance profile.

### Recent API calls with a specific instanceId as the target resource
> Very inefficient I know - room for improvement here

> The CloudTrail UI provides `resource name` as search criteria. Note that `resource name` is not an actual key in the JSON so they're abstracting some query magic. Relevant events may not be included in this CloudTrail API query - otherwise stated, the below Athena query will show you more events for better or worse.

```
select eventTime, eventName, eventSource, userIdentity.arn
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where year = 'xxxx' and month = 'xx' and day = 'xx'
and (requestParameters like '%i-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx%' or responseElements like '%i-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx%')
and eventname not like 'Describe%'
and eventsource = 'ec2.amazonaws.com'
limit 25
```

### EC2 Instance profile - most frequent API calls
```
select eventname, count(*) as total
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where year = '####' and month = '##' and day = '##'
and useridentity.principalid like '%:i-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
group by eventname
order by total desc
limit 25
```

### EC2 Instance profile - most denied API calls 
```
select eventname, count(*) as total
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where year = '####' and month = '##' and day = '##'
and useridentity.principalid like '%:i-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
and errorcode = 'AccessDenied'
group by eventname
order by total desc
limit 25
```

### All EC2 Instance Profiles - most denied instance profiles
```
select useridentity.principalid, count(*) as total
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where year = '####' and month = '##' and day = '##'
and useridentity.principalid like '%:i-%'
and errorcode = 'AccessDenied'
group by useridentity.principalid
order by total desc
limit 25
```

### All EC2 Instance Profiles - most denied event names
```
select eventsource,eventname,count(*) as total
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where year = '####' and month = '##' and day = '##'
and useridentity.principalid like '%:i-%'
and eventname <> 'AssumeRole'
and errorcode = 'AccessDenied'
group by eventsource,eventname
order by total desc
limit 25
```

### EC2 Instance Profile interacting with IAM
EC2 instances rarely have a need for IAM actions. Include an `and eventname <>` clause if legitimate actions are found that muddy the search results.
```
select useridentity.principalid,eventsource,eventname,count(*) as total
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where year = '####' and month = '##' and day = '##'
and useridentity.principalid like '%:i-%'
and eventsource = 'iam.amazonaws.com'
group by useridentity.principalid,eventsource,eventname
order by total desc
limit 25
```

### EC2 Instance Profile enumerating S3
EC2 instances should know exactly which S3 buckets to they need. The ListBuckets action is a strong indicator of compromise...or bad development practices. 
```
select useridentity.principalid,eventsource,eventname,count(*) as total
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where year = '####' and month = '##' and day = '##'
and useridentity.principalid like '%:i-%'
and eventsource = 's3.amazonaws.com'
and eventname = 'ListBuckets'
group by useridentity.principalid,eventsource,eventname
order by total desc
limit 25
```

## General Purpose Queries
These queries are useful for exploring potential issues and building upon for threat hunting.

### Most common API actions for a given day
```
select eventname,count(*) as total
from cloudtrail_000000000000 
where year = '####' and month = '##' and day = '##'
group by eventname
order by total desc
```
### Most common error codes
```
select errorcode, count(errorcode) as total
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where year = '####' and month = '##' and day = '##'
group by errorcode
order by total desc
```

#### Principals getting denied the most
```
select useridentity.principalid, count(*) as deniedactions
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where year = '####' and month = '##' and day = '##'
and errorcode = 'AccessDenied'
group by useridentity.principalid
order by deniedactions desc
limit 25
```

### Common denied actions from specific principal (see above)
```
select eventname, count(*) as total
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where year = '####' and month = '##' and day = '##'
and errorcode = 'AccessDenied'
and useridentity.principalid = 'AROAxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx:i-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
group by eventname
order by total desc
```

## IAM
### Root Credential Use
* Technique: T1078 Valid Accounts
* Tactic: 
  * TA0001 Initial Access
  * TA0003 Persistence
* GuardDuty:
  * Policy:IAMUser/RootCredentialUsage
```
select * 
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where year = '####' and month = '##' 
and useridentity.type = 'Root'
```

```
select *
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where year = '####' and month = '##' 
and eventname = 'ConsoleLogin'
and useridentity.type = 'Root'
```

### Remove MFA from an IAM User
While IAM Policy may still include a condiion that requires MFA, removing MFA from an IAM User enables a pivot to that principal.

* Technique: T1531 Account Access Removal

```
select *
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where year = '####' and month = '##' 
and eventname IN ('DeactivateMFADevice', 'DeleteVirtualMFADevice')
```

### All IAM Changes
* GuardDuty
  * Persistence:IAMUser/UserPermissions

The IAM API has numerous actions for establishing persistence and expanding permissions. The following query removes read only actions. 
```
select useridentity.principalid, eventname, count(*) as total
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where year = '####' and month = '##' and day = '##'
and eventsource = 'iam.amazonaws.com'
and eventname not like 'Get%' 
and eventname not like 'List%'
and eventname not like 'Generate%'
group by useridentity.principalid, eventname
order by total desc
```

### Creation of IAM Principals
```
select useridentity.principalid, eventname, count(*) as total
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where year = '####' and month = '##' and day = '##'
and eventsource = 'iam.amazonaws.com'
and evenname in ('CreateUser','CreateRole','CreateServiceLinkedRole')
```

### Privilege Escalation: IAM Policy
IAM Policy updates used to expand permissions of associated principals (IAM Users, IAM Roles).

* RhinoSec
  * (1) Creating a new policy version
  * (2) Setting the default policy version to an existing version

```
select *
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where year = '####' and month = '##' and day = '##'
and eventName IN ('CreatePolicyVersion','SetDefaultPolicyVersion')
order by eventtime desc
```

### Add/Update Credentials
* RhinoSec:
  * (4) Creating a new user access key
  * (5) Creating a new login profile
  * (6) Updating an existing login profile
* Pacu:
  * ```iam__backdoor_users_keys```
  * ```iam__backdoor_users_password```

```
select *
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where year = '####' and month = '##' and day = '##'
and eventName IN ('CreateAccessKey', 'UpdateAccessKey',

'UploadSigningCertificate','UpdateSigningCertificate','DeleteSigningCertificate',
'UploadSSHPublicKey','UpdateSSHPublicKey','DeleteSSHPublicKey'
)
order by eventtime desc
```

### Privilege Escalation: Adding permissions
Permission expansion may include disassociating a principal from an IAM Policy due to the removal of explicit Deny effects.
* Technique: 
  * T1098 Account Manipulation
* Tactic:
  * TA0003 Persistence
  * TA0006 Account Manipulation
* RhinoSec:
  * (7) Attaching a policy to a user
  * (8) Attaching a policy to a group
  * (9) Attaching a policy to a role
  * (10) Creating/updating an inline policy for a user
  * (11) Creating/updating an inline policy for a group
  * (12) Creating/updating an inline policy for a role
  * (13) Adding a user to a group

```
select *
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where year = '####' and month = '##' and day = '##'
and eventSource = 'iam.amazonaws.com' 
and eventName IN ('AttachUserPolicy', 'DetachUserPolicy',
'AttachRolePolicy', 'DetachRolePolicy',
'PutUserPolicy','PutGroupPolicy','PutRolePolicy',
'DeleteUserPolicy','DeleteGroupPolicy','DeleteRolePolicy',
'DeleteRolePermissionsBoundary')
order by eventtime desc
```

### Privilege Escalation: Expand Access to an IAM Role
* RhinoSec
  * (14) Updating the AssumeRolePolicyDocument of a role
* Pacu
  * ```iam__backdoor_assume_role```

> Updating a trust policy (`UpdateAssumerolePolicy`) allows a service, local account principal, or external account to assume the associate IAM Role and its permissions.

```
select *
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where year = '####' and month = '##' and day = '##'
and eventSource = 'iam.amazonaws.com' 
and eventName IN ('UpdateAssumeRolePolicy')
order by eventtime desc
```
Action | Impact

UpdateAssumeRolePolicy | Persistence / Privilege escalation allowing an IAM User to assume an IAM Role and its associated permissions

### Modify Federated Access
* Tactics
  * TA0001 Initial Access
  * TA0003 Persistence
* Techniques
  * T1098 Account Manipulation
  * T1199 Trusted Relationship

> Adding a new identity provider (`CreateSAMLProvider`)  also requires adding or updating an IAM's Role's trust policy.

> Updating the metadata (`UpdateSAMLProvider`) for a SAML IdP would hijack an existing trusted relationship, but break existing federated access.

```
select *
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where year = '####' and month = '##' and day = '##'
and eventName IN ('CreateSAMLProvider','UpdateSAMLProvider','DeleteSAMLProvider',

## Traffic Mirroring
Traffic Mirroring is a full packet capture (pcap) capability that may be used by an adversary to exfil secrets and sensitive data from unencrypted internal traffic. Within a VPC a traffic mirroring `session` is established with collection `filter` `rules` that identify what traffic to collect and forward to a `target`.

```

Action | Impact
------------ | -------------
CreateTrafficMirrorFilter | expand EC2 isntance inbound traffic permissions (persistance, exfil, or exploit)
CreateTrafficMirrorFilterRule | configures the traffic to capture rules applied to a filter
CreateTrafficMirrorSession | establishes a packet capture session
CreateTrafficMirrorTarget | forwards captures traffic to an adversary controlled resource

## Network Routing

## Lambda
No API event in isolation should be concerning, so the importance of establishing context around Lambda service events is critical. Attackers may use existing Lambda functions to inherit elevated permissions as a pivot, for establishing persistence, or for accessing data. The actions indicated in this section are the most important to look for, but are by no means the only Lambda actions to care about in incident response.
