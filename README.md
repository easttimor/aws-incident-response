# CloudTrail Queries using Athena

This project explores useful CloudTrail events that support incident response and detection of misconfigurations. Documenting the queries and filters used to identify these CloudTrail events helps to:

* build a timeline of events
* understand the scope of the incident
* identify indicators of compromise
* decrease time to containment and recovery

Mis-configurations are important events to identify early. These configurations may introduce a vulnerability, but may also be an indicator of compromise. 

Whether executed manually or by automating, this information may be used to develop incident response playbooks. These types of formalization activities promote a consistent, efficient, and effective response to security incidents. 

To-do:
- [ ] more service coverage (particularly network and storage)
- [ ] consistent mapping to ATT&CK
- [ ] CloudWatch Metrics Filters - equivalent filters for existing EventBridge filters

## Why Athena?
CloudTrail logs should be stored and archived in S3, where they are essentially useless unless integrated with another product or service. Amazon Athena allows you to query these JSON-formatted logs using standard SQL. This approach gives access to a potentially massive amount of CloudTrail data without the cost and effort of implementing Splunk, ElasticSearch, or storing in another database.

### Getting Started
Athena charges for the data scanned for each query. You may only return one record, but will be charged for all data queried to match that record. By default, S3 data is not indexed, so Athena will inefficiently scan a LOT of data. There are also S3 charges (GET requests) that factor in at larger scale.

**But, we can make Athena faster and cost effective by creating partitions.**
Implement CloudTrail Partitioner. By default, Partitioner will create a virtual table for each AWS account so you don't scan an entire aggregated bucket. Partitioner will also add the following partitions:
* region
* year
* month
* day

Including these partitions in your SQL statements, as shown throughout this project, significantly improves query performance by limiting the amount of data scanned. Limiting the amount of data scanned saves money. For ad-hoc queries, such as those used for incident response, this cost is negligible.

### Alternatives
* query direct from CloudTrail: no cost, very limiting query syntax
* query direct from CloudWatch Logs: higher cost than S3, fast query performance but weaker query syntax
* ingest logs in Splunk, ElasticSearch, etc: expensive

## Why EventBridge?
> EventBridge builds on CloudWatch Events and uses the same APIs. This is essentially CloudWatch Events.

Querying CloudTrail, even if automated, is best suited for ad-hoc **response** to finding misconfigurations and investigating incidents. Many of these configuration-related indicators of compromise can be detected in near real time. EventBridge allows for these pre-defined CloudTrail events to be filtered and integrated with numerous alerting methods (e.g. SNS) and event flows (e.g. Lambda, 3rd party SIEM).

This approach is independent of the Athena queries, but both approaches complement each other.

The Terraform section of this project repo includes deployable event filters with a basic SNS notification. Where applicable, Athena queries on this page are reflected in these event filters.

EventBridge is cheap for this use case.

# Incidents
The following section builds a collection of common incidents and the Athena queries that may prove useful in response. These queries attempt to explain timeline, scope,  impact, and surface indicators of compromise. 

## Incident: Access Key Exposure
We are looking for the following:
* what actions has this key been used for, historically and currently?
* has this key been used from any odd locations?
* has this key been used from any odd user agents?

### All key usage
```
select eventtime, eventsource, eventname, sourceip, errorcode, useragent
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where useridentity.accesskeyid = 'AKIAxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
and year = '####' and month = '##'
```
### Look for user agent anomalies
```
select useragent, count(*) as total
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where useridentity.accesskeyid = 'AKIAxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
and year = '####' and month = '##'
group by useragent
order by total desc
```
```
select eventtime, eventsource, eventname, sourceip, errorcode
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where useragent = 'seeAbove'
and year = '####' and month = '##'
```
### Look for source ip anomalies
```
select sourceip, count(*) as total
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where useridentity.accesskeyid = 'AKIAxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
and year = '####' and month = '##'
group by sourceip
order by total desc
```
```
select eventtime, eventsource, eventname, errorcode, useragent
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where sourceip = 'seeAbove'
and year = '####'
and month = '##'
```
## Incident: EC2 Instance Compromise
EC2 instances may have an IAM Role attached to them. The combination of the instance and the role is called an "instance profile". When the role is assumed, the EC2 instance ID is used as the session name part of the Principal ARN in CloudTrail. We can identify actions of EC2 instances using the clause ```useridentity.principalid like '%:i-%'``` or a specific EC2 instance ```useridentity.principalid like '%:i-00000000000000000'```

The actions of EC2 instances will typically be repetitive and persistent, because all actions are presumed to be initiated by software and not a human. Play close attention to any anomalous API calls. An attacker with access to an EC2 instance has access to any IAM permissions granted to that instance via the instance profile.

### Recent API calls with a specific instanceId as the target resource
> Very inefficient I know - room for improvement here

> The CloudTrail UI provides `resource name` as search criteria. Note that `resource name` is not an actual key in the JSON so they're abstracting some query magic. Relevant events may not be included in this CloudTrail API query - otherwise stated, the below Athena query will show you more events for better or worse.

```
select eventTime, eventName, eventSource
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where year = 'xxxx' and month = 'xx' and day = 'xx'
and (requestParameters like '%i-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx%' or responseElements like '%i-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx%')
and eventname not like 'Describe%'
and eventsource = 'ec2.amazonaws.com'
limit 25
```

### Most common API calls by an instance (instance profile / attached IAM Role)
```
select eventname, count(*) as total
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where year = '####' and month = '##' and day = '##'
and useridentity.principalid like '%:i-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
group by eventname
order by total desc
limit 25
```
### ...that were denied
```
select eventname, count(*) as total
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where year = '####' and month = '##' and day = '##'
and useridentity.principalid like '%:i-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx'
and errorcode = 'AccessDenied'
group by eventname
order by total desc
limit 25
```
### EC2 instances getting the most denied actions
```
select useridentity.principalid, count(*) as total
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where year = '####' and month = '##' and day = '##'
and useridentity.principalid like '%:i-%'
and errorcode = 'AccessDenied'
group by useridentity.principalid
order by total desc
limit 25
```
### Collectively, what actions are getting denied the most for EC2 instances
```
select eventsource,eventname,count(*) as total
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where year = '####' and month = '##' and day = '##'
and useridentity.principalid like '%:i-%'
and eventname <> 'AssumeRole'
and errorcode = 'AccessDenied'
group by eventsource,eventname
order by total desc
limit 25
```
### Are any EC2 instances interacting with IAM?
```
select useridentity.principalid,eventsource,eventname,count(*) as total
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where year = '####' and month = '##' and day = '##'
and useridentity.principalid like '%:i-%'
and eventsource = 'iam.amazonaws.com'
group by useridentity.principalid,eventsource,eventname
order by total desc
limit 25
```
### Are any EC2 instances enumarating S3?
```
select useridentity.principalid,eventsource,eventname,count(*) as total
from cloudtrail_000000000000
where year = '####' and month = '##' and day = '##'
and useridentity.principalid like '%:i-%'
and eventsource = 's3.amazonaws.com'
and eventname = 'ListBuckets'
group by useridentity.principalid,eventsource,eventname
order by total desc
limit 25
```
## General Purpose Queries
These queries are useful for exploring potential issues and building upon for threat hunting.

### Most common API actions for a given day
```
select eventname,count(*) as total
from cloudtrail_000000000000 
where year = '####' and month = '##' and day = '##'
group by eventname
order by total desc
```
### Most common error codes
```
select errorcode, count(errorcode) as total
from cloudtrail_000000000000

group by useridentity.principalid
order by deniedactions desc
limit 25
```
### Common denied actions from specific principal (see above)
